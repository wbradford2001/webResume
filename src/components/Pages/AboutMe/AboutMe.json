    "About Me":"My name is William Bradford and I am a 4th year at UC Davis studying Computer Science. I started coding in python making 2D games when I was in middle school and it is something that I really enjoy. I try to constantly learn new things that better prepare me for a career as a software enginer. I am an Amazon Web Services certified developer, and I have built applications with virtual machines, docker containers (with AWS Fargate), and other serverless services (such as S3 and lamda). I used to use Django and React on virtual machines for every project, however I have switched to a more serverless approach to save on cost and convenience. Aside from computer science, I play for my schools D1A Rugby team, and I enjoy going to the gym, watching UFC and playing online video games. Thank you for taking the time to look at my online resume, and I hope you have a wonderful rest of your day."
